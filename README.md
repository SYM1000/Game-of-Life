# Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine.

### Rules 📋

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### Playing 🔧

Clone the project
```
git clone https://github.com/SYM1000/Game-of-Life
```

and run the game

```

## Change the game ⚙️

Change the inital state of the game by changing a cell value to 1

```
gameState = [myX][myY]
```


## Controllers 📦
**Pause the game:** By clicking any key on your keyboard
**Active a cell:** Click on the cell you want to give life to
